<h1> Atlanta Sustainable Fashion Week </h1>
<h6> The application in development is intended to support the Atlanta Sustainable Fashion Weekâ€™s (ASFW) event in late Fall 2022. The app we will develop will allow people to take a quiz to determine their personal style and advise them on how to use existing pieces in combination with sustainably sourced new clothes. Users will be able to see which sustainability metrics are being met by clothing suggestions and make outfits linked to a calendar of personal and professional events. </h5>
